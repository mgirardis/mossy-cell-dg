Runs simulations and plots data for all the models that were developed and compared for the paper (submitted)

# before starting
You need to download the simulation data file https://www.dropbox.com/s/zvrmraxddef3an0/sim_EIFDTBoundSigKLR_spk_features.npz?dl=0 and put it in the folder `data/simulations/no_K_curr`. This is necessary to be able to correctly run the jupyter notebook `plot_eifdtboundsigklr_noKcurr_data_paper.ipynb` and plot the figures from the paper. This data file is too large to be uploaded to github.

# project structure

 * `modules/neurons.py` -> the classes that contain the Runge-Kutta and other numerical methods for all the models (each model is defined as a class). The model that we used to simulate the Mossy Cell dynamics is defined in the class `EIFDTBoundSigKLR`.

 * `data/experiments` -> folder that contains the experimental data that was used to compare with the models

 * `data/simulations` -> folder that contains the data that is plotted in the `plot_eifdtboundsigklr_noKcurr_data_paper.ipynb` notebook, and is presented in the paper. This data was generated by running the simulations in `run_paper_sim.sh`

# running
To run the basic paper simulations (first set the permissions of this script to execute)

    ./run_paper_sim.sh

# plotting
To plot the data we have in the paper (included in the folder `data`), use the following jupyter notebooks

    plot_eifdtboundsigklr_noKcurr_data_paper.ipynb

# get help
